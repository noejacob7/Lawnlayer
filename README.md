It is a game in which the player has to claim a certain percentage of area to proceed to the next level/win the game.

## Power Up 1
The first powerup is a radiation symbol which when the player collects slows down the enemies for 10 seconds. The powerup effect continues even after the player reaches the next level.
A timer is set in the game. The first powerup spawns after 10 seconds into the game. This powerup stays in the map for 10 seconds, after that it disappears. When the player collects the area around any powerup it disappears.
